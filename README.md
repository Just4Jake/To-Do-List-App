# To-Do-List-App
Design the To DO List App with the following menu

 - Registration / Log In
   
 - Profile Section
   
 - Add (+) Icon  (To add a new To Do Task)
   
 - Monitoring Progress


Using your previous TO DO LIST APP,  upgrade it with additional feature.

Implement the following features:

When the user clicks the "Add" button, add the new task with the selected date and time to the list

When the user clicks on a task, mark it as completed (toggle the CheckBox)

When the user long-presses on a task, remove it from the list

Use an ArrayList to store the to-do list data and an Adapter to display the list in the ListView.
